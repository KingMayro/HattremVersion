# Pokemon Hattrem Version

A rom hack of Pokemon Yellow based on the [Pokemon Yellow Disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow) that replaces Pikachu with Hattrem! There are a few changes such as new NPCS, new moves/types (though they are exclusive to Hattrem's set), and a few quality of life features.
