# Pokemon Hattrem Version

A rom hack of Pokemon Yellow based on the [Pokemon Yellow Disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow) that replaces Pikachu with Hattrem! There are a few changes such as new NPCS (coming soon!), new rooms(also coming soon!), new moves/types, and a few quality of life features. The game is still mostly in a demo state considering the lack of other features, but you can finish the entire game with Hattrem if you want to.
